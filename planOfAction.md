Plan of Action
===

By Friday 4/12/13:
+Get to know Google Translate API/research free translation APIs
+Figure out how Chrome Extensions work <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html">here</a>
+Write code that will substitute translated word for original word for every instance in a body of text (and eventually a webpage)

Down the road:
+Vocab lists (either hardcoded or from an API)
+Website with accounts (mongo.db) and quizes
+Graphs to track quiz scores
