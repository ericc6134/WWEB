Win, Wilson, Eric, and Bernie's repo for the final project

<<<<<<< HEAD
Who's doing what: we need to decide which idea we are going to go with

Who's the group leader: Bernie (unless anyone else wants to)

What we'll have done by 4/5: Depends largely one which idea we go with

What we'll have done by 4/12: See above
=======
Since everyone else is either out of town and/or has no internet, Win is here to speak for the group:

I nominate Wilson as group leader. Wilson is now group leader unless he says otherwise.

We'll be making a Google Chrome extension that translates words you want into a given language (we'll start with English -> Spanish only).

By the Friday we get back from break, we should have:

 - a detailed plan of action, which also explains what we'll have done by the Friday after that

 - know-how of Chrome extensions
 - if necessary, a prototype using the Google Translate API.

By the Friday after that:

 - the things detailed on the detailed plan of action we'll have by the Friday we get back from break
